</div><div class="global"><h2>Facebook promotion services open up great opportunities for you</h2>
<p>Today, the very concept of a “social network” is most closely 
associated with Facebook. Therefore, promotion on the social network 
attracts many people. Being the second most visited resource after 
Google, the brainchild of Zuckerberg is trying its best to push its 
competitor off the world pedestal. A lot of search, news, and other 
useful tools were introduced on the platform to do this. They all 
represent a worthy alternative to the all-knowing “god” of the Internet.
 People could care less how much the two digital mastodons’ shares cost.
 But according to the laws of capitalism, a fierce struggle between 
giant companies ultimately benefits regular consumers.</p>
<p>In our case, this resulted in an introduction of many interesting 
features that make Facebook promotion services very efficient for you or
 your products. We’ll talk about them a bit later. Now, let's get 
impressed with the blue-white community’s scale in the context of the 
project’s history. This will help us better understand what 
opportunities Facebook promotion services open up for a user who has 
decided to introduce his new ideas or products to as many people as 
possible through the platform.</p>
<p>Like most breakthrough innovations, Facebook Inc. was born by a team 
of young students from a necessity that had long existed in their minds.
 The problem lied in communicating, in the exchange of academic 
information with selected people and the quick response from 
respondents. Yes, the idea of creating interest groups and following the
 posts of their friends has already existed by that time. But no one 
except Mark Zuckerberg and his team had succeeded in creating effective 
rules and algorithms that make communication really simple and 
effective. So in 2004, the Facebook site was launched, which brought 
together Harvard students and teachers. Promotion services became more 
relevant day by day and since 2006 the service has become publicly 
available. Then, due to an incredibly fast audience expansion, Facebook 
promotion services were first introduced as a way to promote ideas to as
 many people as possible.</p>
<p class="imp">Since then, Facebook has been developed at an incredible 
pace. And the thing is not only in the huge influx of new members. The 
platform itself has developed, providing more and more new features.</p>
<p>It is difficult to determine which one of the aforementioned 
phenomena was primary. Perhaps, it is the wide range of features that 
caused the significant influx of people. But if you take the volume of 
active users as a success indicator, then you can only wonder how Mark 
didn’t faint from it. Facebook promotion services have a strong base, 
which is expressed in the impressive numbers below.</p>
</div><div class="global"><h2>Facebook’s popularity</h2>
<p>Indeed, no other social network has approached over the past ten 
years the indicators that Mark can boast of. This is why promotion 
within the community he’s created becomes more relevant every year. So, 
the numbers. Facebook is:</p>
<ul><li>Second place in terms of traffic.</li>
<li>An audience of more than 2 billion people.</li>
<li>About 800 million users visit the blue-and-white page or use the mobile app daily.</li>
<li>Every day there are 7 billion responses in the form of likes and comments, as well as 400 million photos on Facebook’s servers.</li>
<li>The daily number of video views on the social network has reached 9 billion.</li></ul>
<p><b>The dynamics are interesting as well.</b> Zuckerberg's team has 
managed to double its audience over the past three and a half years. In 
2015, there were “just” 1 billion fans of the service. Such success 
brings huge financial revenues that are successfully spent on acquiring 
companies that may threaten just a bit the Internet giant’s dominance. 
Instagram and WhatsApp stand out among its biggest purchases. We mention
 the popular brands by no coincidence, since promotion on Facebook is 
closely related and significantly accelerates the same process on the 
“subsidiary” platforms. So if you are interested in promotion services, 
Facebook should become the main point of your strategy.</p>
</div><div class="global"><h2>Is Facebook self-promotion possible?</h2>
<p>It’s already become a good tradition from MRPOPULAR to introduce its 
visitors with the methods, which make promotion services and 
self-promotion work faster. We honestly tell you how to become popular 
without using Facebook promotion services. But we also try to evaluate 
the efficiency of these methods in comparison with the service we 
provide. So, let's go...</p>
<ul><li><b>Targeted advertising.</b> We specifically bring up a small 
description of this internal service first. So you can quickly 
understand that, as in the real world, the best and most efficient costs
 money. Promotion campaigns on the social network number one are no 
different from those on competing platforms: self-promotion and use of 
various services get significantly boosted. It works like this: you 
select an audience by interests and geographical location, pay money, 
and your post will be periodically displayed in the feeds of people 
matching the criteria. Such advertising will certainly make Facebook 
promotion more dynamic. However, as you probably already know, ad posts 
are annoying people more and more. Therefore, in terms of the 
price/performance ratio, Facebook promotion makes much more sense. And 
speaking of the price. In this regard, the network is considered the 
most expensive. Which is not surprising, since the price list among 
companies of this kind depends on the number of its users.</li>
<li><b>Cover, profile image.</b> Internet users love with their eyes. In
 the virtual world, the saying “Looks are everything” makes even more 
sense, getting a special meaning. Therefore, for the fastest promotion 
on Facebook, you should make what your visitors see first as attractive 
as possible: the cover and the profile image. Images should be catchy, 
attractive, and in high resolution. If you are more interested in 
promoting a product on Facebook, then it will make more sense to place a
 decent photo of the product right on the cover. Your page promotion 
without using promotion services will noticeably improve if the visitors
 are “hooked” by your profile image. You can use a graphic editor or 
several specialized services to experiment on the cover and profile 
image. You can even create animated graphics using them. Your promotion 
without using the services will speed up. Go for it!</li>
<li><b>Address.</b> You need to make your Facebook page easy to find in 
order to speed up the promotion. The URL address is an important factor 
here. The network provides decent tools for this. You need to select a 
word after the main domain that perfectly matches your product. You 
shouldn’t neglect the well-known rule “the shorter the better” here as 
well. So, make it so your address is easy to remember at a glance. The 
promotion will go a little faster.</li>
<li><b>Template.</b> For a more effective promotion on Facebook, 
attracting covers and profile image will not be enough. You need a nice 
and simple interface. Fortunately, the platform provides a large number 
of templates to choose from. Use the one that is closest to your 
activity. You can choose from the following categories: services, 
company, non-profit organization, restaurant, politics, etc. Customize 
the interface by removing or adding tabs. Your work without using 
Facebook promotion services will certainly work (just kidding). Let's 
move on.</li>
<li><b>Button.</b> Let’s talk more about creating a convenient 
environment for your visitors. Do not forget to insert the “buy” or 
“contact” button. According to all the laws of marketing, it is better 
to place it immediately after the call to action. Facebook promotion 
services have little to do with such a useful feature, but your 
product’s promotion and sales will only benefit from it.</li>
<li><b>Information.</b> Fill out as many “information” sections as you 
can. This will make your visitors much more trustful towards you. 
Moreover, this text field is perfect for a small advertising slogan.</li></ul>
<p>As you can see, promotion on Facebook is not such a simple endeavor, 
especially for a beginner. MRPOPULAR will resolve not only all the 
issues above, but will also use all its tools to accelerate your page 
promotion. Our toolkit contains everything you need: increasing the 
number of followers, buying Facebook visitors, increasing the number of 
post views. Only with us will the promotion become truly effective. 
Contact us, the results are guaranteed.</p></div></div></div></div>
